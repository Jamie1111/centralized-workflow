Once upon a time ..
there was a king...
that had a very big nose...
and as soon as he saw PPDE, he died.
Then I got an ant farm. They didn't grow shit.
They were so cute that i wanted to sell them..
oh nooo
In a place in La Mancha whose name I don't want to remember.
Then there came Piet Piraat
Piet Piraat was on his way to find the One Piece
To see if it was real...
with a sneaky golem
in his pocket
with a berserker behind aka Jaap Berben
led by God Don Pollo of Github
WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
